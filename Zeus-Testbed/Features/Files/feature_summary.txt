Smart Files Feature Summary

== CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ==

A. Architecture & Design
- Pattern: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) for a clean separation of concerns.
- State Management: Utilizes SwiftUI's ObservableObject and the Combine framework for reactive state.
- Communication: Employs NotificationCenter (specifically .didChangeFileData) for decoupled state updates across components.
- Theming: Driven by a protocol-based theme engine (FilesTheme) that provides a single source of truth for all UI styling (colors, fonts, layout), ensuring a consistent and maintainable look inspired by Linear/Raycast.
- Persistence: Uses a sandboxed file system approach within the app's Application Support directory, separating raw file assets (/files) from their Codable-serialized JSON metadata (/metadata) for fast querying.

B. Core Components & Functionality
- Models:
    - FileItem: Central model for files/folders, containing all metadata.
    - Tag: Model for categorizing files.
- ViewModels:
    - SidebarViewModel: Manages sidebar state and selection.
    - FileBrowserViewModel: Manages the collection of files, selection, and CRUD operations.
    - DetailsViewModel: Manages the state for the details/preview pane.
- Views:
    - FilesMainView: Top-level container assembling the three main panes.
    - SidebarView, FileCardView, DetailsView: Custom-built, highly-styled components with hover/selection states, replacing generic SwiftUI views.
    - TagManagementView: A themed popover for managing tags.
- Services:
    - InAppFileStorageManager: Handles all file system interactions.
    - NotificationService: Provides non-intrusive, toast-style user notifications.
- Key Workflows:
    - File Import: Successfully copies files into the app's sandbox and creates associated metadata.
    - Data Flow: A reactive data flow is established for UI updates based on user selections.

== MISSING FEATURES ==

A. Core Functionality
- Hierarchical Navigation: No ability to navigate into or out of folders; the file system is presented as a flat list.
- Search & Filtering:
    - No search capability for filenames or content.
    - No dynamic sorting or advanced filtering beyond the pre-defined smart groups.
- File & Folder Manipulation:
    - No ability to rename files or folders.
    - No ability to move files or folders.
- State Persistence: UI state (window size, selections, layout mode) is not saved across app launches.

B. Interactivity & User Experience
- Drag-and-Drop: Missing for both file import and internal organization.
- Keyboard Navigation: UI is not navigable or controllable via keyboard shortcuts.
- Fluid Transitions: List/Grid layout changes are abrupt, lacking smooth animations.
- Context Menus: Menus are minimal, missing standard actions like "Rename," "Duplicate," etc.
- Undo/Redo: No undo stack for destructive actions like deletion.
- Functional "Recents": The "Recents" smart group is a placeholder with no underlying logic to track recently opened files.
- Rich Previews & Editing: Previews are read-only with no in-app editing or advanced rendering like syntax highlighting.
