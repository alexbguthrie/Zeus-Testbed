## Phase 1: Foundational Navigation & Manipulation

### Milestone 1.1: Hierarchical Navigation (YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Added
- **State Management (`FileBrowserViewModel`):**
    - Introduced `@Published private(set) var navigationPath: [FileItem]` to track the current folder navigation stack for breadcrumbs.
    - Introduced `@Published private var currentFolderID: UUID?` to hold the ID of the current folder being viewed (`nil` represents the root).
- **Navigation Logic (`FileBrowserViewModel`):**
    - Added `navigate(to: FileItem)` to move into a child folder.
    - Added `navigate(toDirectoryAt: Int)` and `navigateToRoot()` to handle backward navigation from breadcrumbs.
- **UI Components (`FilesMainView`):**
    - Created new `HeaderView` to encapsulate all header content.
    - Created new `BreadcrumbView` to display the `navigationPath` and handle navigation clicks.
- **UI Interaction (`FileBrowserView`):**
    - Added `.onTapGesture(count: 2)` to `FileCardView` to trigger `viewModel.navigate(to:)` for folder items.

#### Changed
- **Data Fetching (`FileBrowserViewModel.loadFiles()`):**
    - Refactored to filter the fetched `FileItem` array based on the `currentFolderID`, showing only direct children.
    - Added sorting to always display folders before files, then sort alphabetically.
- **New Folder Creation (`FileBrowserViewModel.createNewFolder()`):**
    - Updated to assign the `currentFolderID` as the `parentID` for newly created folders, ensuring they appear in the correct directory.
- **Header (`FilesMainView`):**
    - Replaced the static header with the new dynamic `HeaderView`.

#### Known Issues & Stubs
- The breadcrumb UI in `HeaderView` could be improved if the path becomes very long; it does not currently truncate or scroll.
- The "Add Files" button in the empty state is still a stub and does not trigger the file importer.

### Milestone 1.2: Context Menus & Core Actions (YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Added
- **Storage (`InAppFileStorageManager`):**
    - Implemented `renameFile(withID:newName:)` to handle physical file rename and metadata update.
    - Implemented `duplicateFile(withID:)` to handle physical file copy and new metadata creation.
- **State Management (`FileBrowserViewModel`):**
    - Added `@Published var fileToRename: FileItem?` and `@Published var isRenaming: Bool` to manage the state of the inline renaming UI.
- **Action Logic (`FileBrowserViewModel`):**
    - Added `startRenaming(file:)` and `commitRename(newName:)` to orchestrate the rename flow.
    - Added `duplicateFile(withID:)` and `toggleFavorite(for:)` to handle user actions.
- **UI (`FileCardView`):**
    - Added a conditional view that swaps the file name `Text` for a `TextField` when `isRenaming` is true for that item.
    - Used `@FocusState` to automatically focus the `TextField` when renaming begins.

#### Changed
- **Context Menu (`FileCardView`):**
    - Expanded the context menu to include "Rename", "Duplicate", and "Toggle Favorite" actions, mapping them to the new ViewModel methods.
- **Overlay (`FileCardView`):**
    - Updated the border logic to show a more prominent accent color when the item is actively being renamed.

#### Known Issues & Stubs
- Renaming a file to an empty string is not prevented and will cause issues. Input validation should be added.
- Toggling a favorite status does not yet visually filter the file list when the "Favorites" smart group is selected.

## Milestone 3.1 - Drag-and-Drop Implementation (2024-06-20)
