- Feat: Added `FilePreviewViewModel.swift` to manage preview logic.
- Feat: Stubbed out placeholder views for different file types:
    - `TextPreviewView.swift`
    - `ImagePreviewView.swift`
    - `PDFPreviewView.swift`
    - `UnsupportedPreviewView.swift`

Milestone: UI Bug Fixes & Polish
Date: 2024-07-29

- Fix: Refactored search bar focus management to meet modern app standards. Centralized `@FocusState` and implemented tap gestures on all main views (`SidebarView`, `FileBrowserView`, `DetailsView`) to ensure focus is correctly resigned when clicking outside the search field.
- Fix: Repaired the filter menu layout by replacing a rigid `HStack` with a custom `FlexibleView`, preventing UI text from garbling on overflow.
- Chore: Resolved "Publishing changes from within view updates" runtime warnings by deferring state changes to the next run loop using `DispatchQueue.main.async`.
- Chore: Updated a deprecated `String(contentsOf:)` initializer to the modern, recommended version.
- Chore: Corrected all SwiftUI preview providers to handle the new `isSearchFocused` binding, resolving all associated compiler errors.
- Files Touched: `FilesMainView.swift`, `SidebarView.swift`, `FileBrowserView.swift`, `DetailsView.swift`, `FileBrowserViewModel.swift`.

Open Todos:
- Resume work on the File Previews milestone.
